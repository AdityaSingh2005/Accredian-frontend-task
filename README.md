# Accredian Frontend Task 🧑🏻‍💻
<p>🚀 Welcome to my submission for the internship selection process! In this project, I've designed a dynamic Login and Sign-Up page using React and CSS. The application features separate components for login and sign-up, incorporates form validation, and ensures a seamless user experience across various screen sizes. Dive into the code to explore my approach to React state management, component design, and responsive styling.</p>

## Key Features
- React components for Login and Sign-Up.
- Form validation for enhanced user input control.
- The pages are visually cohesive and user-friendly.
- Thoughtful CSS styling with attention to detail.
